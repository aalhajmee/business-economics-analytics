# Financial Data Analysis and Planning Dashboard

**BIOL 185 Group Project - Fall 2025**

A modular Shiny web application integrating global macroeconomic analysis, personal finance planning, and retirement risk simulation to explore how global economic conditions influence individual financial decisions and long-term retirement outcomes.

---

## Project Description

This dashboard integrates three analytical layers:

- **Global Macroeconomic Explorer**: Analysis of economic indicators across 200+ countries from 1960-2023
- **Personal Finance Tools**: Savings calculators, loan analysis, and budget planning guides
- **Retirement Risk Simulator**: Monte Carlo simulations for long-term retirement planning scenarios

The application uses classical statistical methods, interactive visualizations, and computational analysis to provide insights into economic trends and personal financial planning.

## Research Questions

### Module 1: Global Macroeconomic Explorer

1. How do GDP growth and inflation trends vary across global regions over time?
2. What is the relationship between unemployment and inflation across countries? (Phillips curve analysis)
3. How does government debt (% of GDP) relate to economic growth across countries?
4. How do GDP per capita and life expectancy correlate?
5. How do exchange rates behave in countries with high inflation?

### Module 2: Personal Finance Tools

- What savings rate is needed to reach specific financial goals?
- How do credit profiles affect loan approval probability?
- What is the total cost of borrowing over different loan terms?

### Module 3: Retirement Risk Simulator

- What is the probability of reaching a retirement goal given current savings and market volatility?
- How do different return scenarios impact long-term portfolio values?
- What is the range of possible retirement outcomes?

## Methodology

**Data Collection:** World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) via R package API, U.S. Census Bureau ACS, Bureau of Labor Statistics, MERIC, and publicly available commodity price datasets.

**Data Processing:** ETL processes documented in R Markdown files. Data cleaning includes removal of aggregate regions, missing value handling, standardization of country codes, and validation checks.

**Statistical Methods:**

**Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, standard deviation):**
Chosen to provide foundational summaries of economic indicators across countries and time periods. Essential for understanding central tendencies and variability in the World Bank WDI data, which spans 200+ countries over 64 years. Interpretation: Reveals typical economic performance levels, identifies outliers, and quantifies dispersion in indicators like GDP per capita, inflation rates, and unemployment.

**Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
Selected to measure linear relationships between economic indicators (e.g., GDP and life expectancy, inflation and unemployment). Highly relevant for the World Bank dataset where multiple indicators are tracked simultaneously. Interpretation: Identifies which economic factors move together (positive correlation) or inversely (negative correlation), revealing potential economic relationships such as the wealth-health connection or trade-offs between inflation and unemployment.

**Simple Linear Regression (OLS):**
Chosen to quantify how much variation in a dependent variable (e.g., life expectancy) can be explained by independent economic factors (GDP, unemployment, government debt). Directly applicable to the cross-country panel data structure of the WDI dataset. Interpretation: Provides coefficients indicating the magnitude and direction of relationships, allowing statements like "a $1,000 increase in GDP per capita is associated with X years of life expectancy increase."

**ANOVA for Regional Comparisons:**
Selected to test for statistically significant differences in economic indicators across global regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa vs. North America). Appropriate for the categorical regional groupings inherent in the World Bank data classification. Interpretation: Determines whether observed regional disparities are statistically meaningful or due to random variation, providing evidence for geographic economic inequality.

**Chi-Square Test of Independence:**
Selected to test whether economic indicator categories (e.g., high/low GDP per capita, high/low inflation) are independent of geographic regions. Appropriate for categorical data analysis where countries are classified into economic categories and regional groups. Interpretation: Determines if there is a statistically significant association between economic performance levels and geographic regions. A significant result indicates that certain regions are more likely to have specific economic characteristics, revealing geographic patterns in economic development.

**Monte Carlo Simulation (monthly granularity):**
Selected to model retirement portfolio uncertainty by simulating thousands of possible future scenarios. Appropriate for financial planning where market returns and inflation are stochastic. Interpretation: Provides probability distributions of retirement outcomes, success rates (percentage of simulations where money remains), and confidence intervals. Monthly granularity captures realistic volatility patterns better than annual models.

**Gradient Descent Logistic Regression (loan approval):**
Chosen to predict binary outcomes (loan approval/rejection) based on borrower characteristics. Trained on historical loan approval data to learn patterns in creditworthiness. Interpretation: Provides probability scores for loan approval, helping users understand how factors like income, credit score, and employment history influence approval likelihood. The gradient descent approach allows the model to learn from data without requiring explicit statistical assumptions.

**Visualization:** Interactive time-series plots, scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, choropleth maps, and dual-axis comparisons using plotly and ggplot2.
